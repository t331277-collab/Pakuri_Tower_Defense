## Task: Stage Basic Enemy Spawn Rule Reset

### Task title

Reset RunScene enemy spawn positions to `stage-basic-rules.md`.

### Goals

- Treat the current RunScene battlefield as bottom-left `(0,0)` and top-right `(31,17)`.
- Treat `EnemySpawnPoint` X as `33`.
- Spawn normal enemies from X `33` with random Y in `0~17`.
- Spawn boss enemies from `(33,8)`.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground all claims in actual files and command output.
- Do not run Unity-MCP Play Mode gameplay verification; user performs Play Mode verification.
- Run Code Reviewer once only after implementation.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder implementation, local validation, and one Code Reviewer PASS completed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies in Unity Play Mode that normal enemies spawn along Y `0~17` from X `33`, and bosses spawn near `(33,8)`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/reference/5.enemy/stage-basic-rules.md` says screen coordinates are `(0,0)` to `(31,17)`, default spawn X is `33`, normal monster Y is random `0~17`, and boss default point is `(33,8)`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/EveVerticalSliceController.cs` previously serialized `enemySpawnYRange = new Vector2(6f, 10f)`.
- `SpawnEnemy()` previously used `enemySpawnAnchor.position` and applied the random Y range as an offset from `DefaultEnemySpawnPosition.y`.
- `EveVerticalSliceController.cs` now serializes `enemySpawnYRange = new Vector2(0f, 17f)`.
- `EveVerticalSliceController.cs` now defines `EnemySpawnX = 33f`, `BossSpawnY = 8f`, and `DefaultEnemySpawnPosition = new Vector3(EnemySpawnX, BossSpawnY, 0f)`.
- `ResolveEnemySpawnPosition(bool isBoss)` now forces X to `33`, uses Y `8` for bosses, and uses random Y from `enemySpawnYRange` for normal enemies.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/RunScene.unity` now stores `EnemySpawnPoint` at `{x: 33, y: 8, z: 0}` and `enemySpawnYRange: {x: 0, y: 17}`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity reference warnings.
- Unity console error query returned only an MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit log, not a project script compile error.
- External Code Reviewer one-shot review returned `REVIEW_RESULT: PASS` in `codex_loop_logs/stage_basic_spawn_reviewer_20260428.md`.

### History

- 2026-04-28: User requested enemy spawn rules reset based on `Pakuri/reference/5.enemy/stage-basic-rules.md`, treating the RunScene field as `(0,0)` to `(31,17)` and `EnemySpawnPoint` X as `33`.
- 2026-04-28: Code Builder updated `EveVerticalSliceController.cs` and `RunScene.unity` to match the document rules.
- 2026-04-28: External Code Reviewer one-shot review returned `REVIEW_RESULT: PASS`; Play Mode gameplay verification remains user-owned.

## Task: EnemySpawnPoint Editable Position

### Task title

Allow scene-edited `CombatRoot/EnemySpawnPoint` position to persist when starting the game.

### Goals

- Stop runtime scene reference resolution from resetting an existing `EnemySpawnPoint` to the hardcoded default `(29, 8, 0)`.
- Keep default creation behavior for missing anchors.
- Make enemy spawn placement use the edited `EnemySpawnPoint` transform position, including vertical movement.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder after Designer handoff.
- User explicitly requested no Code Reviewer stage for this task; proceed with self-review only.
- All claims must be grounded in actual code and command output.
- User performs Play Mode verification.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder implementation and self-review completed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User moves `CombatRoot/EnemySpawnPoint` in `RunScene`, starts Play Mode, and verifies the marker no longer returns to `(29, 8, 0)`.
- User verifies spawned enemies appear around the edited `EnemySpawnPoint` position.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/EveVerticalSliceController.cs` previously called `EnsureChild(enemySpawnAnchor, "EnemySpawnPoint", new Vector3(29f, 8f, 0f))`.
- `EnsureChild()` previously assigned `current.position = worldPosition` and `existing.position = worldPosition`, which reset existing anchors.
- Added `DefaultEnemySpawnPosition` and changed `EnsureChild()` so existing `current` or found children are returned without overwriting their position.
- `SpawnEnemy()` now starts from `enemySpawnAnchor.position` and applies the configured Y random range as an offset from the default spawn Y, so edited spawn point Y also affects spawn placement.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity reference warnings.
- External Code Reviewer command was started but the user interrupted it and instructed to proceed with self-review only.

### History

- 2026-04-28: User reported that editing `Combat Root/EnemySpawnPoint` in the scene is reverted when starting the game.
- 2026-04-28: Confirmed reset cause in `EveVerticalSliceController.ResolveSceneReferences()` and `EnsureChild()`.
- 2026-04-28: Changed existing anchor handling to preserve scene-authored positions and adjusted enemy spawn placement to use the anchor transform as the base position.
- 2026-04-28: Per user instruction, skipped Code Reviewer and kept only Builder self-review plus build verification.

## Task: Enemy Target Priority Monster First

### Task title

Enemy combat flow targets the selected Monster before the Nexus.

### Goals

- Enemies should move toward and attack the Monster before attacking the tower/Nexus.
- If the Monster HP reaches 0, enemies should fall back to the existing Nexus target and Nexus defeat flow.
- Keep the change grounded in the existing `EveVerticalSliceController` combat flow.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- User will run Play Mode verification.
- Do not claim gameplay verification; only build, Unity refresh, console check, and self-review are performed here.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder implementation and self-review completed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies in Play Mode that Stage 1 enemies approach the selected Monster first.
- User verifies that Monster HP decreases before Nexus HP, and Nexus starts taking damage only after Monster HP reaches 0.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/EveVerticalSliceController.cs` now calls `GetEnemyPriorityTarget()` in `UpdateEnemies()` before moving or attacking.
- `GetEnemyPriorityTarget()` returns `eveAnchor` while `unitCurrentHealth > 0f`, then falls back to `nexusAnchor`.
- Enemy damage skills now call `ApplyEnemyDamageToPriorityTarget()`, which subtracts from `unitCurrentHealth` first and from `nexusCurrentHealth` only after Monster HP is depleted.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity assembly version warnings.
- Unity refresh reached idle. Console error query showed MCP-FOR-UNITY transport/client handler entries only; no project script compile error was returned.

### History

- 2026-04-27: User requested enemies attack Monsters before hitting the tower.
- 2026-04-27: Confirmed the existing `UpdateEnemies()` flow targeted only `nexusAnchor` and the existing damage function subtracted only `nexusCurrentHealth`.
- 2026-04-27: Changed enemy movement and damage target selection to prefer the Monster while alive, with Nexus fallback after Monster HP reaches 0.
- 2026-04-27: Follow-up self-review fixes applied. Enemy attacks now resolve through `EnemyAttackResolver`, Monster defenses are cloned into runtime target defenses, enemy critical passive bonuses are copied from enemy stats into runtime, and fallback Stage 1 enemy ScriptableObjects are cached with `HideFlags.DontSave`.
- 2026-04-27: Ranged and melee/ranged enemies now fire enemy projectiles. HP damage is resolved only when those projectiles collide with the Monster or Nexus. Enemies now create a simple overhead `TextMesh` label showing name and HP.

## Task: Enemy Projectile And Overhead HP Display

### Task title

Ranged enemies use projectiles and enemies show simple overhead name/HP labels.

### Goals

- Ranged enemies should no longer damage the Monster or Nexus immediately at attack time.
- Enemy projectiles should apply HP damage only after touching the Monster or Nexus target.
- Enemies should show a simple overhead name and HP text.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- User performs Play Mode verification.
- All claims must be grounded in actual files and command output.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder implementation and self-review completed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies in Play Mode that Archer/Rogue/Hero Karin style ranged attackers spawn visible enemy projectiles.
- User verifies Monster/Nexus HP changes only when enemy projectiles reach the target.
- User verifies enemy overhead labels remain readable enough and update HP after taking damage/healing.

### Evidence

- `EveVerticalSliceController.cs` `ProjectileRuntime` now has enemy projectile fields: source enemy, target transform, and Monster/Nexus target flag.
- `TryUseStageOneEnemySkill()` now routes `EnemyAttackType.Ranged` and `EnemyAttackType.MeleeAndRanged` default attacks through `FireEnemyProjectile()`.
- `UpdateProjectiles()` now branches enemy projectiles into `TryHitEnemyProjectileTarget()`, which applies Monster or Nexus damage only on collision.
- `SpawnEnemy()` now creates an overhead `TextMesh` through `CreateEnemyLabel()`, and `UpdateEnemyLabel()` writes enemy name and current/max HP.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity assembly version warnings.
- Unity refresh reached idle. Console error query returned MCP-FOR-UNITY transport/client handler entries only, not project script compile errors.

### History

- 2026-04-27: User requested ranged enemy projectiles with collision-based HP damage and simple overhead enemy name/HP display.
- 2026-04-27: Implemented enemy projectile runtime path and overhead TextMesh labels in `EveVerticalSliceController.cs`.
