## Archive Note

- Full pre-cleanup snapshot moved to `boards/ARCHIVE/DATA_BLACKBOARD_ARCHIVE_2026-05-18.md`.
- Older CSV-transition history remains in `boards/ARCHIVE/CSV_BLACKBOARD_ARCHIVE_2026-05-14.md`.
- This active file now keeps only the current runtime CSV authority, cleanup decisions, and archive destinations still needed for ongoing work.
- 2026-05-26 cleanup: non-core task details older than 2026-05-24 were moved to `boards/ARCHIVE/BOARD_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`.

## Task: 2026-05-27 Sein-C/D Delayed Projectile And Residual Zone CSV Authoring

### Task title

Extend the active skill/effect/status CSV authority required for Sein-C delayed projectile behavior and Sein-D residual zone behavior.

### Goals

- Keep Sein-C delayed impact, projectile delay tuning, and follow-up effects authored in the active CSV files.
- Keep Sein-D residual ember zone authored in the active effect CSV instead of a helper skill row.
- Keep new schema additions reusable for future skills.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Skill Builder / Code Builder.
- User explicitly approved widening scope to shared runtime/common-logic extension and new CSV columns when required.
- `monster_skill_choices.csv damage_delay_multiplier` and `monster_skill_effects.csv active_duration_seconds / tick_interval_seconds` are now part of the active authoring authority for this runtime path.
- Some effect values remain explicit inferences until a stronger authority is provided:
  - `sein-c-master-1` residual zone radius `1.2`, tick `0.5s`
  - `sein-d-master-2` residual zone radius `3.2`, tick `0.5s`
- Unity Play Mode gameplay verification remains user-owned.

### Role Owner

Skill Builder / Code Builder

### Status

Implemented, synced, and compile-verified.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `damage_delay_multiplier` for future projectile delay tuning before adding another choice field.
- Reuse `active_duration_seconds` and `tick_interval_seconds` in effect rows for future persistent follow-up zones before creating helper active-skill rows.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` header now includes `damage_delay_multiplier`; `sein-c-trait-4` uses `0.6`.
- The same choice CSV now authors Sein-C trait/master and Sein-D trait/master rows on shared fields, including conditional status damage for `sein-c-trait-5` and `sein-d-trait-5`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_effects.csv` header now includes `active_duration_seconds` and `tick_interval_seconds`.
- The same effect CSV now contains `sein-c-master2-contact`, `sein-c-master1-zone`, and `sein-d-master2-zone`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` now authors `sein-c` as `CooldownProjectile` with `damage_delay_seconds=0.8` and authors `sein-d` with active duration, tick interval, and status payload values used by the shared runtime.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/status_effects.csv` now contains the shared Sein status rows required by those choices.
- Unity menu execution for `Pakuri/Validate CSV Source Data` and `Pakuri/Sync CSV Runtime Catalog Assets` produced filtered console logs `PakuriCsvRuntimeData loaded runtime catalog from resource source 'Pakuri/CSVRuntime/PakuriCsvRuntimeSourceCatalog' with 5 monsters and 8 stage-one enemies.` and `Pakuri CSV runtime catalogs synced from 'Assets/CSVdata/source' to 'Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime'.`
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` both passed with 0 errors; existing `MSB3277` warnings remain.

### History

- 2026-05-27: Sein-C and Sein-D required active CSV authoring support for projectile-delay tuning and effect-authored residual zones; the user approved the necessary schema widening.

## Task: 2026-05-26 Rin-E SingleAttack Core Hitbox CSV Schema

### Task title

Extend active skill CSV authority for SingleAttack prefab core-hitbox effects and Rin-E authoring.

### Goals

- Add a base active-skill prefab path column so active skill rows can provide `SkillEffectPrefab`.
- Add shared choice columns for prefab core-hitbox damage, core-hitbox additional damage, and hit-count cooldown refund.
- Author Rin-E enhancement and master rows as `RuntimeImplemented`.
- Add Rin-E master-2 slow as a choice-gated OnHit status row in `monster_skill_effects.csv`.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Skill Builder / Code Builder.
- CSV source remains the active authority; no Rin-only companion table was added.
- CSV files were exported as UTF-8.
- Unity CSV runtime catalog sync is pending because batchmode reported another Unity instance has this project open.

### Role Owner

Skill Builder / Code Builder

### Status

Implemented, compile-verified, and synced through the open Unity Editor menu after the follow-up CSV validation fix.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `core_hitbox_name`, `core_damage_multiplier`, `core_on_hit_additional_damage_*`, and `hit_count_cooldown_refund_*` for future SingleAttack prefab-center effects before adding another schema.
- User verifies Rin-E master 2 slow behavior in Play Mode.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` now has 57 columns and `rin-e.skill_effect_prefab_path=Assets/Prefab/Skill/Rin/Rin_E.prefab`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` now has 86 columns including the shared core-hitbox and hit-count cooldown refund fields.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_effects.csv` now has 77 parsed rows and contains `rin-e-master2-slow`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs`, and `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.AssetReferences.cs` now parse, map, and collect the base `skill_effect_prefab_path` and new choice fields.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Definition/SkillDefinition.cs`, `SkillChoiceEffectSpec.cs`, `InGameSkillDefinitionMapper.cs`, and `SkillExecutionSnapshot.cs` now carry the new shared choice fields into runtime snapshots.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors; existing `MSB3277` warnings remain.
- `cmd /c SyncCsvRuntimeCatalogs.bat` failed only because Unity batchmode reported another Unity instance has `C:/TowerDefence_Pakuri/Test/Pakuri` open.
- Follow-up enum validation found the `DamageAttribute` enum defines `Darkness`, not `Dark`; `monster_skill_choices.csv` and `monster_skill_effects.csv` Rin-E rows were corrected to `Darkness`, and a CSV enum scan returned `ENUM_VALIDATION_OK`.
- Follow-up status-scope validation found `StatusEffectRuntime.TryParseStatusTargetScope(...)` only accepts `self` and `all_allies`; `rin-e-master2-slow` now leaves `status_target_scope` blank like other enemy OnHit status rows, while `target_side=Enemy` remains the target authority.
- `.NET TextFieldParser` scans returned `FIELD_COUNT_OK` for `monster_skill_effects.csv` 61 columns / 78 lines, `monster_skill_choices.csv` 86 columns / 252 lines, `monster_skills.csv` 57 columns / 52 lines, and `monster_skill_triger.csv` 34 columns / 10 lines.
- Unity menu `Pakuri/Sync CSV Runtime Catalog Assets` logged `Pakuri CSV runtime catalogs synced from 'Assets/CSVdata/source' to 'Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime'.` after the fix.

### History

- 2026-05-26: User requested full Rin-E Skill Builder implementation with the SingleAttack blueprint and `Assets/Prefab/Skill/Rin/Rin_E.prefab`.
- 2026-05-26: User reported Unity auto-sync failing on `monster_skill_effects.csv` row 78 because `attribute=Dark` was not a valid enum value; Builder corrected the CSV enum values and checked for remaining enum mismatches.
- 2026-05-26: User reported Unity CSV validation still failing on `rin-e-master2-slow status_target_scope=enemy`; Builder cleared that unsupported scope, verified the relevant CSV schemas and enum/status-scope scans, and synced the runtime catalog through the open Unity Editor menu.

## Task: 2026-05-26 SingleAttack Damage Delay CSV Schema

### Task title

Add `damage_delay_seconds` to active monster skill CSV and carry it into SingleAttack runtime data.

### Goals

- Let `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` author per-skill SingleAttack hit delay.
- Default every existing monster skill row to `0` so current immediate-hit behavior remains unchanged until rows are tuned.
- Carry the field through `SkillRow`, `SkillDefinition`, `SingleAttackData`, validation, and mapper code.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- CSV source remains the active authority; no companion table was added.
- Existing row count and quoted CSV structure must remain parseable.
- Unity batchmode catalog sync could not complete while another Unity instance had the same project open.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and compile-verified. Runtime catalog asset sync is pending through the open Unity Editor menu or a later batch sync after closing Unity.

### Next Actions

- Tune `damage_delay_seconds` values in `monster_skills.csv` for specific SingleAttack rows.
- Sync runtime catalog assets once Unity project locking allows it.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` now has `damage_delay_seconds` after `knockback_distance`; every existing data row is `0`.
- CSV parser verification returned `records=52`, `fields=56 records=52`, `damage_delay_index=50`, `type=float`, and `nonzero_defaults=0`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs` parses optional `damage_delay_seconds`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs` maps `DamageDelaySeconds` into `SkillDefinition`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Definition/SkillDefinition.cs`, `Skills/Data/SingleAttackData.cs`, `Skills/Data/InGameSkillDefinitionMapper.cs`, and `Skills/Data/InGameSkillDataValidator.cs` now carry and validate the value.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors; existing `MSB3277` warnings remain.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors when rerun alone after a first parallel-build file lock.
- `cmd /c SyncCsvRuntimeCatalogs.bat` failed with Unity's duplicate-project-open guard for `C:/TowerDefence_Pakuri/Test/Pakuri`.

### History

- 2026-05-26: User requested Code Builder implementation of Designer's N-second delayed SingleAttack hit timing plan with default CSV value `0`.

## Task: 2026-05-26 Rin-B/C Shared Beam Buff And Status CSV/Runtime Extension

### Task title

Extend the shared CSV/runtime contracts required to finish Rin-B and Rin-C on the active Scripts2 skill path.

### Goals

- Add shared beam knockback and per-hit reload-reduction choice data for Rin-C.
- Add shared effect/status payload fields for Rin-B master-2 style outgoing additional damage without passive-trigger ownership hacks.
- Keep Rin-B trait/master extra buffs and Rin-C master slow authored in the active CSV tables.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Skill Builder.
- User explicitly approved current Rin CSV/reference files as the parsed source for this task.
- No Rin-only companion CSV table was added; the work stays inside `monster_skills.csv`, `monster_skill_choices.csv`, and `monster_skill_effects.csv`.
- CSV/runtime claims are grounded in inspected source rows and runtime mapper/executor code.

### Role Owner

Skill Builder

### Status

Implemented and compile-verified.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `knockback_distance`, `knockback_distance_multiplier`, `reload_reduce_target_skill_id`, and `reload_reduce_seconds_per_hit` for future beam/line skills before adding another schema.
- Reuse `status_outgoing_additional_damage_*` for future buff/status-authored extra-hit behavior before adding a trigger-only side table.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` now includes `knockback_distance`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` now includes `knockback_distance_multiplier`, `reload_reduce_target_skill_id`, and `reload_reduce_seconds_per_hit`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_effects.csv` now includes `status_outgoing_additional_damage_multiplier`, `status_outgoing_additional_damage_trigger_attribute`, and `status_outgoing_additional_damage_attribute`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.StatusPayload.cs`, and `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs` now parse and map those new columns.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Definition/SkillDefinition.cs`, `Skills/Data/BeamSkillData.cs`, `Skills/Data/SkillChoiceEffectSpec.cs`, `Skills/Execution/Modifiers/SkillChoiceModifierRecord.cs`, and `Skills/Execution/Runtime/SkillExecutionSnapshot.cs` now carry the new shared Rin-B/C data through runtime snapshots.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Skills/Data/StatusEffectKind.cs` and `StatusEffectRuntime.cs` now carry status-authored outgoing additional damage fields keyed by `DamageAttribute`.
- `Import-Csv -Encoding UTF8 Pakuri\Assets\CSVdata\source\monster_skill_choices.csv | Where-Object { $_.skill_id -in @('rin-b','rin-c') }` returned all Rin-B/C choice rows with `runtime_support_state=RuntimeImplemented`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors after the schema/runtime changes; existing MSB3277 warnings remain.

### History

- 2026-05-26: User approved the wider Rin CSV/reference inspection exception required by the Skill Builder boundary and requested full Rin-C then Rin-B implementation.

## Task: 2026-05-24 Skill On-Hit Additional Damage CSV Schema

### Task title

Add shared choice CSV fields for direct on-hit extra damage and every-nth-hit chain damage.

### Goals

- Keep on-hit extra damage authored in `monster_skill_choices.csv`.
- Keep Rin-A master-2 off the projectile `branch_*` launch override fields.
- Carry the new CSV fields through runtime source rows, `SkillChoiceDefinition`, `SkillChoiceEffectSpec`, and `SkillExecutionSnapshot`.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder / Skill Builder.
- User provided the parsed Rin-A master-2 values in the request.
- CSV source stayed UTF-8 and imported successfully through Unity.
- No new companion CSV table was added.

### Role Owner

Code Builder / Skill Builder

### Status

Implemented and synced into runtime catalog assets.

### Next Actions

- Future skills needing direct hit-target extra damage should reuse `on_hit_additional_damage_*`.
- Future skills needing deterministic nth-hit nearby chain damage should reuse `on_hit_chain_*`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` now includes `on_hit_additional_damage_chance`, `on_hit_additional_damage_multiplier`, `on_hit_additional_damage_attribute`, `on_hit_additional_damage_target`, `on_hit_chain_hit_period`, `on_hit_chain_target_count`, `on_hit_chain_search_radius`, `on_hit_chain_damage_multiplier`, `on_hit_chain_damage_attribute`, and `on_hit_additional_damage_visual`.
- `Import-Csv -Encoding UTF8 Pakuri\Assets\CSVdata\source\monster_skill_choices.csv` showed `rin-a-master-2` with `on_hit_additional_damage_chance=1`, `on_hit_additional_damage_multiplier=0.4`, `on_hit_chain_hit_period=3`, `on_hit_chain_target_count=2`, and blank branch chance/count/launch fields.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs` parses the new optional columns.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs`, `SkillDefinition.cs`, `SkillChoiceEffectSpec.cs`, `SkillChoiceModifierRecord.cs`, and `SkillExecutionSnapshot.cs` carry the new fields into runtime choice snapshots.
- Unity-MCP editor execution returned `rin-a-master-2|extra=True:1:0.4:Lightning:HitTarget|chain=3:2:4.5:0.4:Lightning|branch=False:False:0:False`.
- Unity `Pakuri/Sync CSV Runtime Catalog Assets` logged a successful sync from `Assets/CSVdata/source` to `Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime`.

### History

- 2026-05-24: User requested the additional damage behavior as a common skill on-hit option rather than a projectile-only branch extension.

## Task: 2026-05-24 Rin-A Choice CSV Authoring

### Task title

Author Rin-A remaining choice behavior on the active `monster_skill_choices.csv` runtime authority.

### Goals

- Add reusable nth-projectile-launch branch override columns to the active choice CSV.
- Move Rin-A trait 5 from unsupported critical prose to shared critical bonus fields.
- Move Rin-A master 2 from unsupported prose to shared branch fields plus launch-period override fields.
- Preserve Rin-A master 1 on the already-supported damage, magazine, and shot-interval fields.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Skill Builder.
- User explicitly approved current CSV/code as the parsed source.
- No new monster-specific companion table was added.
- CSV stayed UTF-8 and all rows now have the same 59-column shape.

### Role Owner

Skill Builder

### Status

Implemented and synced into runtime catalog assets.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `branch_launch_period` and `branch_launch_chance_set` for future projectile skills that need "every Nth projectile launch" branch chance overrides.
- Keep future critical projectile choices on `crit_chance_bonus` and `crit_damage_bonus` before adding new critical schema.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` header/type rows now include `branch_launch_period` and `branch_launch_chance_set`.
- `Import-Csv -Encoding UTF8 Pakuri\Assets\CSVdata\source\monster_skill_choices.csv` showed `rin-a-trait-5` as `crit_chance_bonus=0.1`, `crit_damage_bonus=0.25`, and `RuntimeImplemented`.
- The same import showed `rin-a-master-2` as `branch_chance_set=0.4`, `branch_count=2`, `branch_damage_multiplier=0.4`, `branch_search_radius=4.5`, `branch_launch_period=3`, `branch_launch_chance_set=1`, and `RuntimeImplemented`.
- Unity `Pakuri/Sync CSV Runtime Catalog Assets` logged a successful sync from `Assets/CSVdata/source` to `Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors; existing MSB3277 warnings remain.

### History

- 2026-05-24: User requested Skill Builder implementation for Rin-A master-2, remaining enhancements, and master-1 using current CSV/code as parsed source.

## Task: 2026-05-24 Eve F-J Passive Effect/Trigger CSV Schema And Authoring

### Task title

Extend shared passive effect/trigger CSV data so Eve F-J can stay fully data-authored on the current runtime catalog path.

### Goals

- Add shared effect columns for target-status-conditional status chance and status-id-specific applied-duration bonuses.
- Add shared trigger columns for condition status, attribute gating, proc chance, and internal cooldown.
- Re-author Eve F-J passive rows so the remaining `DataOnlyUnsupported` / `ReferenceDirect` Eve passive rows move onto shared runtime support.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Skill Builder / Code Builder.
- Current CSV files were explicitly treated as the parsed source for this task.
- No new Eve-only CSV file was added; the work stayed inside `monster_skill_effects.csv`, `monster_skill_triger.csv`, and `monster_skill_choices.csv`.
- External Code Reviewer was not run because explicit user permission was not given.

### Role Owner

Skill Builder / Code Builder

### Status

Implemented, compile-verified, and Unity CSV validation passed.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `status_conditional_target_status_id` plus `status_conditional_status_chance_bonus` for future passive rows that say "extra status chance only against targets already carrying X".
- Reuse `status_applied_status_duration_bonus_status_id` plus `status_applied_status_duration_bonus` for future rows that extend only one applied status without editing global status defaults.
- Reuse `condition_status_id`, `trigger_attribute`, `proc_chance`, and `internal_cooldown_seconds` before adding another trigger companion table.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_effects.csv` header/type rows now include `status_conditional_target_status_id`, `status_conditional_status_chance_bonus`, `status_applied_status_duration_bonus_status_id`, and `status_applied_status_duration_bonus`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_triger.csv` header/type rows now include `condition_status_id`, `trigger_attribute`, `proc_chance`, and `internal_cooldown_seconds`.
- Eve F-J rows in `monster_skill_choices.csv` are now all `RuntimeImplemented`; `eve-g-trait-3`, `eve-i-trait-3`, and `eve-j-trait-3` target the active skills they modify instead of staying passive-note-only.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.StatusPayload.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs`, and `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Validation.cs` now parse, map, and validate the new effect/trigger columns.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` both passed with 0 errors after the schema and row-authoring change; only the existing `MSB3277` warnings remained.
- Unity `Pakuri/Validate CSV Source Data` succeeded after the follow-up validation fix, which confirmed the new headers, rows, and shared trigger semantics were accepted by the runtime catalog loader.

### History

- 2026-05-24: User asked Skill Builder to resume the interrupted Eve F-J passive implementation, which required shared passive effect and trigger schema expansion plus Eve row authoring.

## Task: 2026-05-18 Active Runtime CSV Authority

### Task title

Keep the current Scripts2 runtime CSV authority explicit and compact.

### Goals

- Keep active runtime authority on `Assets/CSVdata/source/*.csv` plus `Assets/CSVdata/EnemySkillData.csv`, with monster choice runtime data unified into `monster_skill_choices.csv` and `monster_modifier_skill_choice.csv`.
- Keep reward IDs, runtime choice IDs, and stage/enemy/monster CSV responsibilities separated.
- Keep base monster/enemy skill visual prefab authority out of active skill CSV rows now that `EffectManager` owns those scene mappings.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Unity Play Mode verification remains user-owned.
- Code Reviewer execution requires explicit user permission and was not run for the retained tasks.
- Detailed intermediate migration steps remain in the archive snapshot.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Current active CSV authority summarized and retained for future work. 2026-05-18 Code Builder moved monster projectile/status tuning out of `monsters.csv` and into per-skill rows in `monster_skills.csv`. 2026-05-18 Code Builder added a one-command CSV runtime sync batch path and status-column validation/fallback for supported status labels. 2026-05-19 Code Builder superseded the old reward/modifier split by unifying monster choice runtime data into `monster_skill_choices.csv` plus the slim `monster_modifier_skill_choice.csv` gate file.

### Next Actions

- If future cleanup resumes, continue from this active runtime-authority split instead of reviving archived duplicate CSV tables.
- When CSV ownership changes, update this file together with `boards/RUN/RUN_BLACKBOARD.md` and `boards/COMBAT/ENEMY_BLACKBOARD.md`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/stage_one_enemies.csv` carries the active enemy authored rows, including the current `basic_skill` plus `stage_one_skill` split.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/EnemySkillData.csv` carries active enemy skill tuning rows.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_modifier_skill_choice.csv` now carries the active monster choice gate rows, while `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` now carries the unified choice display plus runtime modifier rows.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_reward_choices.csv` and `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/SkillChoiceModifierData.csv` were deleted in the 2026-05-19 unification pass because active Scripts2 runtime code no longer reads them.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` now keeps rows such as `rin-a-trait-5`, `rin-a-master-2`, and `ariel-a-master-1` explicitly marked `DataOnlyUnsupported` when current Scripts2 runtime still lacks the required special-case logic.
- After the 2026-05-26 execute-related choice-schema extension, `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_choices.csv` was normalized so all active rows now match the 78-column header again; post-fix field-count scans returned `UTF8_ALL_ROWS_OK` and `ALL_ROWS_OK_AFTER_BOM`, and the file was rewritten as UTF-8 BOM for cross-tool readability.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.*` files remain the active runtime load/build/validation path.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Core/EffectManager.cs` plus `Assets/Scenes/NewScene/NewRunScene.unity` now own base monster/enemy skill effect prefab authority instead of `monster_skills.csv` / `EnemySkillData.csv`.
- `Pakuri/reference/Archive/InactiveRootCsv/` now stores archived inactive root CSV files that are no longer part of the active runtime path.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monsters.csv` no longer contains monster-level `projectile_speed`, `magazine_capacity`, `reload_duration`, `shot_interval`, `status_effect_label`, unit/projectile color, unit/projectile sprite path, projectile lifetime, or projectile hit radius columns.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skills.csv` now owns per-skill `projectile_speed`, `pierce_count`, `status_chance`, and `status_effect_label`; its deleted `range` column is no longer read by `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Skills/Data/InGameSkillDefinitionMapper.cs` now maps projectile speed, base pierce, and status chance from `SkillDefinition` instead of hardcoded Ariel-A/Eve-A branches.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Skills/Data/InGameSkillDefinitionMapper.cs` now falls back from blank `status_effect_id` to a parseable `status_effect_label`, so supported labels such as `媛먯쟾`, `?뷀솕`, `異붿쐞`, `鍮숆껐`, `痍⑥빟`, and `諛⑹뼱留? can resolve through `StatusEffectKind`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Validation.cs` now fails validation when `status_chance > 0` points at an unsupported runtime status label/id.
- `SyncCsvRuntimeCatalogs.bat` calls Unity batchmode with `-executeMethod Pakuri.Data.PakuriCsvRuntimeData.SyncAndValidateCsvRuntimeCatalogsForEditor`; when the project was already open in Unity, batchmode correctly failed with Unity's duplicate-project-open guard, and the same method was then invoked through Unity-MCP.
- Unity console after the MCP invocation logged `PakuriCsvRuntimeData loaded runtime catalog from resource source 'Pakuri/CSVRuntime/PakuriCsvRuntimeSourceCatalog' with 5 monsters and 8 stage-one enemies.` and `Pakuri CSV runtime catalogs synced and validated from 'Assets/CSVdata/source' to 'Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime'.`
- Unity `Pakuri/Sync CSV Runtime Catalog Assets` also logged `Pakuri CSV runtime catalogs synced from 'Assets/CSVdata/source' to 'Assets/Resources/Pakuri/CSVRuntime'.` after the 2026-05-26 `monster_skill_choices.csv` row-width normalization follow-up.
- `Import-Csv -Encoding UTF8 Pakuri\Assets\CSVdata\source\monster_skills.csv` now shows only Eve's supported runtime statuses with positive `status_chance`: `eve-a shock 0.15`, `eve-b slow 0.2`, `eve-c chill 1`, `eve-d shock 1`, and `eve-e vulnerable 1`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors; existing `System.Net.Http` and `System.IO.Compression` MSB3277 warnings remain. A first parallel runtime/editor build hit only an `obj\Debug\Assembly-CSharp.dll` file lock, then runtime passed when rerun alone.

### History

- 2026-05-18: EffectManager scene authority, reward/choice separation, enemy dual-skill CSV authority, and inactive root CSV archiving were recorded as the current active data baseline.
- 2026-05-18: Code Builder consolidated monster projectile/status tuning into `monster_skills.csv`, removed duplicate/visual projectile columns from `monsters.csv`, and removed Ariel-A/Eve-A hardcoded projectile/status values from the shared mapper/executor path.
- 2026-05-18: Code Builder added `SyncCsvRuntimeCatalogs.bat`, exposed `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.SyncAndValidateCsvRuntimeCatalogsForEditor()` for Unity batchmode, normalized unsupported design-only monster status labels to `status_chance=0`, and verified sync/validation through the open Unity Editor.
- 2026-05-19: Code Builder first added shared-projectile-compatible `rin-a` modifier coverage, then unified monster choice runtime data into `monster_skill_choices.csv` / `monster_modifier_skill_choice.csv` and kept crit-only / every-third-hit chain behavior explicitly unsupported where current Scripts2 runtime still has no matching contract.
- 2026-05-26: Follow-up maintenance after the Rin-D execute schema extension normalized legacy `monster_skill_choices.csv` rows to the 78-column header, rewrote the file as UTF-8 BOM, and re-synced the runtime catalog without CSV fatal errors.

## Task: 2026-05-26 Rin F-J Passive CSV Trigger/Effect Schema

### Task title

Extend active monster skill CSV schema for reusable trigger actions, count gates, and conditional passive effects.

### Goals

- Add reusable CSV columns for delayed trigger actions, event skill filtering, event source scope, count gates, effect triggers, cooldown refunds, reload reduction, and status-source conditions.
- Add reusable effect columns for health-ratio conditions, hit-count conditions, and critical-damage status bonuses.
- Keep Rin F-J passive authoring in the active `Assets/CSVdata/source` CSV authority path.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder / Skill Builder.
- Active CSV scope stayed limited to routed Rin skill-authoring files: `monster_skills.csv`, `monster_skill_choices.csv`, `monster_skill_effects.csv`, and `monster_skill_triger.csv`.
- No new CSV file was added.

### Role Owner

Code Builder / Skill Builder

### Status

Implemented, synced, and validation passed.

### Next Actions

- Reuse `trigger_action`, `event_skill_id`, `target_skill_id`, `triggered_effect_id`, `trigger_delay_seconds`, `trigger_every_count`, and `event_source_scope` for future passive trigger work before adding another trigger table.
- Reuse `condition_health_ratio_max`, `condition_hit_count_min`, and `status_critical_damage_bonus` for future passive effects before adding specialized columns.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_triger.csv` header/type rows now include `trigger_action`, `event_skill_id`, `target_skill_id`, `triggered_effect_id`, `condition_status_source_skill_id`, `trigger_delay_seconds`, `trigger_every_count`, `event_source_scope`, `cooldown_refund_ratio`, and `reload_reduce_ratio`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/CSVdata/source/monster_skill_effects.csv` header/type rows now include `condition_health_ratio_max`, `condition_hit_count_min`, and `status_critical_damage_bonus`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts2/InGame/Data/Runtime/Csv/PakuriCsvRuntimeData.MonsterDataset.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Build.cs`, `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.StatusPayload.cs`, and `PakuriCsvRuntimeData.Validation.cs` now parse, map, and validate the new CSV fields.
- CSV field-count scan passed after authoring: `monster_skill_effects.csv` 64 columns / 91 lines, `monster_skill_triger.csv` 44 columns / 26 lines, `monster_skill_choices.csv` 86 columns / 252 lines, and `monster_skills.csv` 57 columns / 52 lines.
- Unity `Pakuri/Validate CSV Source Data` completed with the runtime catalog load summary and no Pakuri CSV validation failure.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 errors; existing MSB3277 warnings remain.

### History

- 2026-05-26: Rin F-J passive implementation required reusable trigger/action/count/effect schema instead of one-off runtime branches, and the user approved that extension.
