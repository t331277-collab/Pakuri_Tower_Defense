## Task: 2026-05-05 RunScene MonsterPanel 1P Skill Status UI

### Task title

Bind RunScene MonsterPanel to 1P selected Monster active skill state.

### Goals

- Use the scene-authored RunScene `MonsterPanel` instead of replacing it with generated UI.
- Keep `1PMonster` active and future 2P-5P Monster groups inactive for now.
- Show learned active skills in `Active1` through `Active3`, with current-ammo-only TMP magazine count for magazine skills and a vertical cooldown/reload overlay.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Preserve user-authored RunScene UI layout and images.
- User performs Play Mode gameplay verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly permit it.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User verifies RunScene Play Mode behavior as rewards add active skills, including current-ammo-only text such as `10`, `9`, `8` and per-skill cooldown overlays on Active1-3.
- Run Code Reviewer only if explicitly requested.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/RunScene.unity` contains `MonsterPanel`, `1PMonster`, and multiple `Active1` / `Active2` / `Active3` names.
- Unity-MCP loaded-scene inspection found `RunCombatCanvas/MonsterPanel/1PMonster/Active1`, `Active2`, and `Active3`, plus `2PMonster` through `5PMonster`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` now binds `CombatMonsterPanelUiController` from `RunCombatUiController.InitializeUi()` and runtime `Update()`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` now binds existing slot `Text (TMP)` descendants through `TMP_Text` and no longer creates `CountText`.
- `Select-String -LiteralPath Pakuri\Assets\Scenes\RunScene.unity,Pakuri\Assets\Scenes\DebugScene.unity -Pattern "CountText"` found no saved `CountText` after the follow-up cleanup.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/CombatRuntimeController.cs` now provides the skill state snapshot used by the panel.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing warnings.
- Follow-up builds for both projects completed with 0 errors after the TMP ammo binding change.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up: Rin B/C/D/E are no longer stored as `MagazineProjectile` in `rin.asset` or `monster_skills.csv`; Active slots now classify Rin A as the only Rin magazine skill.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up: `CombatRuntimeController.CreateMonsterPanelSkillView(...)` now requires `MagazineCapacity > 0` before using ammo/reload state, so Active2/3 non-magazine skills use their own slot cooldowns.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up: `RunCombatUiController.cs` disables TMP ammo text for non-magazine slots and assigns `DebugUiSolid` to `CooldownOverlay` so the black filled image can visibly drain as cooldown completes.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up validation: runtime and Editor builds completed with 0 errors after rerunning the Editor build sequentially; Unity-MCP read-only asset check reported `rin-b:Buff`, `rin-c:LineAttack`, `rin-d:Execute`, `rin-e:AreaAttack`, and console errors were only MCP client handler logs.

### History

- 2026-05-05: User requested RunScene MonsterPanel behavior for current 1PMonster active skills, magazine text, and cooldown/reload overlay.
- 2026-05-05: User requested replacing `CountText` / `10/10` ammo display with a single `Text (TMP)` current-count display and reported copied cooldown behavior; Builder changed the shared UI binder so each slot uses its own snapshot and TMP text.
- 2026-05-05: User reported Howling/Shockwave Active2/3 still had ammo and Active1-like cooldown; Builder fixed Rin data and the shared MonsterPanel display guard.

## Task: 2026-04-26 Run UI Implementation Status Report

### Task title

HTML report for completed and incomplete Run / UI implementation work on 2026-04-26

### Goals

- Compare today's implementation against `run-systems-integration-summary-report.html` and `monster-select-run-ui-expansion-plan.html`.
- Document completed work, incomplete work, UI editability issues, and chosen UI editing direction.

### Constraints

- All claims must be based on actual files, scene state, command output, or `BLACKBOARD.md` history.
- Do not include work-time estimates in the report.
- Reflect the user's decision that game data is made inside Unity and consumed from Unity assets, not from runtime CSV loading.
- Reflect the user's decision that UI will use editable scene UI: Codex may create a base UI, and user-authored UI should be modified/bound rather than replaced.

### Role Owner

Designer

### Status

Completed.

### Next Actions

- User can open `Pakuri/reference/2026-04-26-run-ui-implementation-status-report.html` to review the report.

### Evidence

- Created `Pakuri/reference/2026-04-26-run-ui-implementation-status-report.html`.
- The report references actual implementation files including `MainMenuFlowController.cs`, `RunCombatUiController.cs`, `RunSceneBootstrap.cs`, `RunStartContext.cs`, `RunSession.cs`, `MonsterDefinition.cs`, and `GameDataCatalog.cs`.
- File timestamp check confirmed the report exists under `Pakuri/reference`.
- Updated the report to remove work-time content, UI Toolkit incomplete-scope content, and user Play Mode verification from the incomplete-scope table.
- Updated the report to state that CSV is not the runtime data path; Unity-created assets such as `MonsterDefinition` and `GameDataCatalog` are the chosen data source.

### History

- 2026-04-26: User requested an HTML work report based on `run-systems-integration-summary-report.html` and `monster-select-run-ui-expansion-plan.html`.
- 2026-04-26: Read both source HTML files, implementation file lists, data asset lists, scene file timestamps, manifest TextMeshPro evidence, and generated the report.
- 2026-04-26: User requested removal of Play Mode verification, work-time content, and UI Toolkit incomplete-scope content; user also fixed the direction to Unity-created data assets and editable scene Canvas UI. Updated the report accordingly.

## Task: RunScene Reward Button Visibility Fix

### Task title

RunScene stage-clear reward buttons are fixed editable slots and visible when rewards exist

### Goals

- Fix the RunScene issue where stage-clear reward buttons did not appear.
- Keep reward UI objects editable in Edit Mode instead of relying on delete/recreate behavior.
- Preserve authored button labels where possible, while runtime reward labels are still assigned from actual reward data.

### Constraints

- No external reviewer for this task; perform simple self-review only.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode; user performs gameplay verification.
- All claims must be based on actual files, scene state, or command output.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder fix applied and self-reviewed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies RunScene stage clear: reward panel appears with reward buttons, selecting a reward enables the continue flow.
- If reward panel appears but a button is blocked or misplaced, inspect the saved RectTransform values of `RewardPanel`, `RewardButtons`, and `RewardButton_0..2`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` now uses fixed `RewardButton_0`, `RewardButton_1`, and `RewardButton_2` slots under `RewardButtons`.
- `RebuildRewardButtons()` clears only the tracked button list, calls `EnsureRewardButtonSlots(false)`, then activates slots based on `combatController.GetRewardChoiceCount()`.
- `EnsureRewardButtonSlots()` repairs zero-height `RewardButtons`, ensures the three named button slots, and hides non-slot legacy buttons such as `RewardPreviewButton`.
- Existing nonzero reward button slot RectTransforms keep their authored positions/sizes; default positions are applied only when a slot is newly created or has a broken zero size.
- `EnsureButton()` now preserves existing non-empty labels unless an overwrite is explicitly requested or a label is newly created/empty.
- Unity MCP RunScene inspection after `OnEnable` reported `RewardButton_0`, `RewardButton_1`, and `RewardButton_2` active in Edit Mode, and `RewardPreviewButton` inactive.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity assembly version warnings.
- Unity console error check after clearing showed MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit logs only, not project script compile errors.

### History

- 2026-04-26: User reported RunScene reward buttons do not appear.
- 2026-04-26: Scene inspection found `RewardButtons` previously had zero height and fixed reward slots were missing, while monster assets contained reward choice data.
- 2026-04-26: Added persistent reward slots, repaired reward root sizing, hid legacy preview buttons, and made existing RunScene reward UI visible in Edit Mode.

# Task: 2026-05-07 RunSession Learned Skill ID Refactor

### Task title

RunScene offering UI uses skill/passive IDs for learned checks.

### Goals

- Keep RunScene UI display text on `DisplayName` while learned-state logic uses stable IDs.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Evidence must come from inspected code and build/Unity-MCP output.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly permit Reviewer execution for this task.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User should Play Mode verify active/passive offering buttons, enhancement offerings, and master skill offerings.

### Evidence

- Changed `RunCombatUiController.cs` offering view fields from `ActiveSkillName`/`PassiveSkillName` to `ActiveSkillId`/`PassiveSkillId`.
- `RunCombatUiController.cs` still renders titles with `skill.DisplayName` and `passive.DisplayName`, while learned checks now call `currentSession.HasLearnedActive(skill.SkillId)` and `currentSession.HasLearnedPassive(passive.PassiveId)`.
- Search evidence after edits found no remaining display-name learned checks under run scripts.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity reference warnings.
- Unity-MCP console warning/error check after compile returned only MCP client handler logs.

### History

- 2026-05-07: Code Builder updated RunScene UI learned-state logic to follow the ID-based `RunSession` refactor.
