# DEBUGSCENE_UI

This is a domain-specific persistent state file created by the BLACKBOARD.md hierarchy migration.
When doing related work, follow MDTREE.md routing and update this file together with any required parent or child files.

## DebugScene UI Authoring Rule

- DebugScene UI must be authored as editable scene uGUI objects whenever the user needs to adjust position, size, text, child hierarchy, checkmarks, or labels in the Unity Editor.
- Runtime code may ensure required infrastructure such as `Canvas`, `EventSystem`, root shell state, and missing visual bindings, but it must bind existing scene objects instead of replacing user-editable panels with runtime-only generated UI.
- `DebugSceneController.Awake()` should keep the current pattern: `DisableRunSceneControllers()`, `ResolveReferences()`, `EnsureCanvasShell()`, `EnsureEventSystem()`, then `BindSceneUi()`.
- `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A` through `Passive_J`, and `Choice_01` through `Choice_08` are scene-authored UI anchors. If a future task changes this structure, update this board and the shared UI board in the same task.
- Use project-owned UI sprites such as `Assets/Resources/DebugUiSolid.png`; do not depend on Unity built-in skin paths such as `UI/Skin/UISprite.psd`.

## Migrated Task Blocks

## Task: 2026-05-05 DebugScene MonsterPanel 1P Skill Status UI

### Task title

Bind DebugScene MonsterPanel to debug-selected 1P Monster active skill state.

### Goals

- Use the scene-authored DebugScene `MonsterPanel` as an editable UI object.
- Keep only `1PMonster` active for the current single-Monster debug flow.
- Reflect DebugScene active-skill toggles through `Active1` through `Active3`, including current-ammo-only TMP magazine text and cooldown/reload overlay when combat is running.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Preserve user-authored DebugScene UI layout and existing skill debug panels.
- User performs Play Mode gameplay verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly permit it.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User verifies DebugScene Play Mode behavior after selecting a Monster, toggling skills, and pressing Start, including that only `Text (TMP)` shows magazine ammo and each Active slot follows its assigned skill cooldown.
- Run Code Reviewer only if explicitly requested.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity` contains `MonsterPanel`, `1PMonster`, and `Active1` / `Active2` / `Active3` object names.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs` now binds `CombatMonsterPanelUiController` after `BindSceneUi()` and during `Update()`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` contains the shared `CombatMonsterPanelUiController` used by both RunScene and DebugScene.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` now uses `TMP_Text` for MonsterPanel ammo text, writes only current ammo, and no longer creates `CountText`.
- Unity-MCP Edit Mode cleanup removed three saved `CountText` objects from `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`; a loaded-scene check returned `CountTextInLoadedScene=0`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/CombatRuntimeController.cs` now exposes selected active skill snapshots that work after `ApplyDebugSelection(...)` updates the selected Monster and learned active set.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing warnings.
- Follow-up `git diff --check -- Pakuri\Assets\Scripts\Run\RunCombatUiController.cs Pakuri\Assets\Scenes\DebugScene.unity` completed with no whitespace errors and CRLF conversion warnings only.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up: Rin B/C/D/E runtime kind data was corrected away from `MagazineProjectile`, and the shared MonsterPanel binder now requires `MagazineCapacity > 0` before showing ammo or using the selected Monster's global magazine/reload state.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up: non-magazine TMP ammo text is disabled per slot, and `CooldownOverlay` receives `DebugUiSolid` so DebugScene's Active1-3 cooldown fill has a visible black overlay while the assigned skill cooldown drains.
- 2026-05-05 follow-up validation: runtime and Editor dotnet builds completed with 0 errors after rerunning the Editor build sequentially; Unity-MCP asset import reported `rin-b:Buff`, `rin-c:LineAttack`, `rin-d:Execute`, `rin-e:AreaAttack`, and console errors remained limited to MCP client handler logs.

### History

- 2026-05-05: User requested DebugScene MonsterPanel behavior matching the combat-screen-layout character skill group.
- 2026-05-05: User reported DebugScene MonsterPanel `CountText` duplication and Active2/Active3 copied-state behavior; Builder removed saved `CountText` objects and changed the shared binder to use existing TMP text per slot.
- 2026-05-05: User reported Howling/Shockwave still showed ammo and followed Active1 cooldown; Builder corrected Rin skill kind data and strengthened the shared MonsterPanel UI binder.

## Task: 2026-05-04 DebugScene Editable UI Authoring Rule

### Task title

Record the user-commanded DebugScene UI authoring rule in the related board files.

### Goals

- Preserve the user's rule that DebugScene UI should remain editable by the user in the Unity Editor.
- Tie the rule to the existing retrospective report and current `DebugSceneController` / `DebugScene.unity` evidence.
- Clarify that runtime code should bind and repair scene-authored UI, not replace it with runtime-only generated panels.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder because the user explicitly requested markdown updates.
- Do not modify `Pakuri/reference` planning/report files for this task.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly request it.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented as a markdown-only board update.

### Next Actions

- Apply this rule to future DebugScene UI changes before editing `DebugSceneController.cs` or `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`.
- If a future UI task affects shared UI policy, update `boards/UI/UI_BLACKBOARD.md` together with this file.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html:195-197` states the user correction: runtime-generated UI made position, size, and child hierarchy hard to inspect/edit, and the current code calls `BindSceneUi()` instead of `BuildUi()`.
- The same report at `:233-237` states that code guarantees the Canvas shell and EventSystem while binding panels and toggle slots saved in the scene.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:50-56` currently calls `EnsureCanvasShell()`, `EnsureEventSystem()`, and `BindSceneUi()` from `Awake()`.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugScene.unity` contains `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `Choice_01`, and `Choice_08`.
- Unity-MCP `manage_scene get_active` returned active scene `DebugScene` at `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`.
- Unity-MCP `find_gameobjects` found one object each for `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `Choice_01`, and `Choice_08`.

### History

- 2026-05-04: User asked to record in the related `.md` files the UI creation method they commanded in the retrospective report, including that UI must be editable by the user.

## Task: 2026-05-03 DebugSetupPanel Show/Hide Toggle

### Task title

Give DebugScene a setup-panel toggle button that can hide and restore `DebugSetupPanel`.

### Goals

- Allow `DebugSetupPanel` to be hidden without losing the ability to reopen it.
- Keep the toggle button outside the panel so it remains clickable after the panel is hidden.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground the change in actual `DebugSceneController` code.
- User performs Play Mode verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly request it for this task.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User verifies in DebugScene Play Mode that pressing the setup toggle hides `DebugSetupPanel`, and pressing it again restores the panel.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:42` adds the `setupToggleButton` field.
- `DebugSceneController.cs:187-193` now binds `SetupToggleButton` from the root canvas, or creates a fallback root-level button if the scene does not already contain that object.
- `DebugSceneController.cs:504-511` adds `ToggleSetupPanelVisibility()`, `:667-685` adds setup-panel visibility/label refresh helpers, and `:724-732` positions the fallback button at the top-right of the root canvas.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and only the existing Unity/MCP warnings.
- Unity refresh completed with `resulting_state: idle`; console error query returned MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit logs only.

### History

- 2026-05-03: User requested a DebugScene button that can turn `DebugSetupPanel` off and back on.
- 2026-05-03: Code Builder added the root-level setup toggle workflow and revalidated the scripts.

## Task: DebugScene UI Canvas Retrospective Report

### Task title

DebugScene UI Canvas initial approach, user corrections, and fix history HTML report.

### Goals

- Analyze the recent DebugScene UI Canvas work log.
- Summarize the initial runtime-generated UI approach, user correction requests, reviewer findings, and final scene-bound UI solution.
- Write the result as an HTML report under `Pakuri/reference/Report`.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Designer.
- Ground all claims in actual files, code, and command output.
- Do not implement runtime gameplay changes for this report.
- Preserve the repository rule that Play Mode gameplay verification is user-owned.

### Role Owner

Designer

### Status

Completed.

### Next Actions

- Use `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html` as the current written summary if the DebugScene UI flow needs to be discussed again.

### Evidence

- `Get-Content -LiteralPath AGENTS.md` and `Get-Content -LiteralPath BLACKBOARD.md` were run before the response.
- `rg` was not available in this PowerShell environment, so `Select-String` was used.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugSceneController.cs` contains `EnsureCanvasShell`, `BindSceneUi`, `ConfigureToggleVisuals`, and `Resources.Load<Sprite>("DebugUiSolid")`.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugScene.unity` contains `DebugSceneController`, `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `Choice_01`, and `Choice_08`.
- `Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath Pakuri\Assets\Resources` confirmed `DebugUiSolid.png` and `DebugUiSolid.png.meta` exist.
- Added `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html`.

### History

- 2026-04-30: User requested an HTML summary of the initial DebugScene UI canvas creation method, user correction points, and how the problems were solved.
- 2026-04-30: Designer reviewed BLACKBOARD task history and current DebugScene code/scene evidence, then added the retrospective HTML report.

## Task: Eve Arc Branch And DebugScene Skill Toggle Runtime

### Task title

Narrow Eve Arc Bolt extra projectile spread, implement immediate lightning branch damage, and add DebugScene skill-toggle testing UI.

### Goals

- Reduce the extra projectile spread angle for Eve A Arc Bolt.
- Change Eve A lightning branch semantics from status chance to immediate branch damage on hit.
- Draw a thin straight rectangular lightning line from the hit enemy to each branch target.
- Add a DebugScene-only controller under `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity` that can test the 5 monster assets and toggle skills A-J plus enhancement/master effects.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground all claims in actual files and command output.
- Do not run Unity-MCP Play Mode gameplay verification; user performs Play Mode verification.
- Do not run external Code Reviewer unless the user explicitly grants permission.
- The current data model has `SkillSlot` A-J only; there is no K enum value. DebugScene shows K as a disabled no-data toggle rather than inventing runtime data.
- Preserve unrelated existing worktree changes from previous Eve runtime and report tasks.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder correction pass completed for the prior `eve-a-master-1` findings, DebugScene UI flow was reworked to match the newer user request, and a follow-up SkillDebugPanel visibility fix was applied. A later Builder pass changed `DebugSceneController` toward scene-bound editable UI and saved static skill/choice toggle slots into `DebugScene.unity`. User then instructed Builder to restore `DebugSetupPanel` and setup controls; those scene paths were restored and build/console validation passed. The later root-scale finding was fixed by serializing the `DebugSceneController` root `RectTransform` scale as `{1,1,1}` and by guarding only the zero-scale case in `EnsureCanvasShell()`, while external Code Reviewer execution is deferred until user permission.

### Next Actions

- User Play Mode verifies `DebugScene` because Codex does not run Unity-MCP Play Mode gameplay verification.
- Run external Code Reviewer only after explicit user permission.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Data/SkillDefinition.cs` defines `SkillSlot` A through J only; no K slot exists.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Data/GameData/Monsters/eve.asset` has `eve-a-trait-5` with branch chance text and `eve-a-master-1` with branch circuit text.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/CombatRuntimeEveSkills.cs` now uses `EveArcExtraProjectileAngleStep = 3f` instead of the previous 4-degree spread step.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Combat/CombatRuntimeProjectiles.cs` now applies branch damage immediately after an Eve projectile hit, selects nearby targets within branch radius, and creates line visuals through `CreateEveArcBranchLine`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs` was added to create a DebugScene-only uGUI panel with 5 monster buttons, skill toggles, enhancement/master toggles, and immediate `RunSession` restart into `CombatRuntimeController.BeginConfiguredDay(...)`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity` now contains a `DebugSceneController` object wired to `Assets/Data/GameData/GameDataCatalog.asset` and `CombatRoot`.
- In `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`, the duplicated `RunSceneBootstrap` and `RunCombatUiController` components are serialized disabled to keep DebugScene separate from the RunScene flow.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity script refresh/compile was requested; editor state returned `ready_for_tools=true`, and Unity console error query returned only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs, not project compile errors.
- External Code Reviewer returned `REVIEW_RESULT: NEEDS_CHANGES`.
- Reviewer finding 1: `eve-a-master-1` branch damage is implemented as 100% in `CombatRuntimeEveSkills.cs`, but `Pakuri/reference/2.Monster/eve/skill/a-arc-bolt.md` says branch damage is 60%.
- Reviewer finding 2: `eve-a-master-1` does not add the documented magazine +2; `GetEveArcMagazineCapacity()` currently only applies `eve-a-trait-1` +4.
- User approved the Reviewer findings. `CombatRuntimeEveSkills.cs` now sets `eve-a-master-1` branch damage multiplier to `0.60f`, and `GetEveArcMagazineCapacity()` now adds `+2` for `eve-a-master-1`.
- User clarified DebugScene flow: starting DebugScene must not spawn enemies; user selects monster, opens skill debug, toggles A-J, chooses enhancement effects in a separate closable UI, then presses Start to spawn enemies.
- `CombatRuntimeController.cs` now exposes `ApplyDebugSelection(...)` so DebugScene can update selected monster/skill state without calling `BeginPrototypeDay(...)` or spawning enemies.
- `DebugSceneController.cs` now keeps monster selection and skill/enhancement configuration separate from `StartCombat()`, uses `BeginConfiguredDay(...)` only when Start is pressed, and uses `ApplyDebugSelection(...)` for pre-start or mid-combat debug changes.
- `DebugSceneController.cs` now disables passive F unless active A is checked; unchecking A also clears F.
- `DebugSceneController.cs` now opens an enhancement modal when a skill/passive is checked, and the modal has a close button.
- `DebugSceneController.cs` ignores prisoner reward UI entirely; after combat resolves, the existing `CombatRuntimeController` stays resolved until the DebugScene Start button is pressed again.
- Follow-up `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- Follow-up `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity script refresh/compile was requested; editor state returned `ready_for_tools=true`, and Unity console error query returned only MCP-FOR-UNITY transport/client handler logs, not project compile errors.
- User reported the SkillDebugPanel skill list was not visible.
- `DebugSceneController.OpenSkillWindow()` now activates `SkillDebugPanel` before rebuilding its toggles.
- `DebugSceneController.RebuildSkillToggles()` and `OpenEnhancementModal()` now call `RefreshToggleContentHeight(...)` after creating toggles so ScrollRect content has a concrete height.
- `DebugSceneController.EnsureToggle(...)` now assigns fixed toggle anchors/pivot plus `LayoutElement` min/preferred height, and `EnsureScrollContent(...)` assigns fixed scroll viewport `LayoutElement` height.
- Follow-up `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- Follow-up `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity script refresh/compile was requested after the SkillDebugPanel fix; follow-up refresh returned `resulting_state=idle`, and Unity console error query returned only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs, not project compile errors.
- External Code Reviewer command was attempted for the latest DebugScene changes, but Codex CLI exited with usage-limit errors and did not return a review verdict.
- User reported the SkillDebugPanel skill list still did not appear and requested editable scene UI instead of UI generated during game execution.
- `DebugSceneController.cs` was changed so `Awake()` calls `BindSceneUi()` instead of `BuildUi()`, and the controller now binds buttons/toggles from scene object paths instead of creating panels/toggles at runtime.
- Unity Edit Mode code saved static toggle objects in `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`: `Active_A` through `Active_E`, `Passive_F` through `Passive_J`, and `Choice_01` through `Choice_08`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity refresh/compile completed with editor state `ready_for_tools=true`; Unity console error query showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs, not project compile errors.
- Required external Code Reviewer returned `REVIEW_RESULT: FAIL`.
- Reviewer finding 1: `DebugSceneController.cs` line 156 requires direct child `DebugSetupPanel`, but `DebugScene.unity` line 8213 shows only `SkillDebugPanel` and `EnhancementModal` under `DebugSceneController`; `Select-String` found no `m_Name: DebugSetupPanel`.
- Reviewer finding 2: `DebugSceneController.cs` line 166 expects `Title`, `Status`, `CombatText`, `MonsterButtons`, `SkillWindowButton`, and `StartButton` under `DebugSetupPanel`, but scene search found those setup paths absent.
- User instructed Code Builder to restore `DebugSetupPanel` and setup controls into the scene and re-run build validation.
- Unity Edit Mode code restored and saved scene objects for `DebugSetupPanel`, `DebugSetupPanel/Title`, `DebugSetupPanel/Status`, `DebugSetupPanel/MonsterButtons`, `DebugSetupPanel/SkillWindowButton`, `DebugSetupPanel/StartButton`, and `DebugSetupPanel/CombatText`.
- The same scene save pass also ensured `SkillDebugPanel/SkillScroll/Viewport/Content`, `EnhancementModal/ChoiceScroll/Viewport/Content`, A-J skill toggles, and `Choice_01` through `Choice_08` exist as editable scene objects.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity refresh/compile completed; Unity console error query showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs and did not show the previous `DebugSceneController requires DebugSetupPanel...` project error.
- Required external Code Reviewer verified the requested scene paths now exist, but returned `REVIEW_RESULT: FAIL`.
- Latest Reviewer finding: `DebugScene.unity` line 10104 stores `DebugSceneController` root `RectTransform` with `m_LocalScale: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}`; since child UI is parented under this root, the UI can remain visually collapsed/non-interactive.
- User later instructed that Code Reviewer must be run only with user permission.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity` now stores the `DebugSceneController` root `RectTransform` with `m_LocalScale: {x: 1, y: 1, z: 1}`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs` now restores `transform.localScale` only when it is exactly `Vector3.zero`, preserving non-zero user-edited UI scale and position.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A` through `Active_E`, `Passive_F` through `Passive_J`, and `Choice_01` / `Choice_08` are present in `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`.
- Unity read-only `execute_code` confirmed `DebugSceneController/SkillDebugPanel/SkillScroll/Viewport/Content` has children `Active_A,Active_B,Active_C,Active_D,Active_E,Passive_F,Passive_G,Passive_H,Passive_I,Passive_J`.
- Unity `mcpforunity://scene/gameobject/65632` showed the loaded `DebugSceneController` transform scale and lossyScale are `{1,1,1}`.
- User reported that `Content` child skill toggles were clickable but their descriptions and checkmark were invisible.
- `DebugSceneController.ConfigureToggle(...)` now calls `ConfigureToggleVisuals(...)` to rebuild each scene-bound toggle slot's `Background`, `Checkmark/Glyph`, and `Label` visuals every time the slot is bound.
- `DebugSceneController.ConfigureToggleVisuals(...)` uses a separate `Checkmark/Glyph` child `Text` as the Toggle graphic, because the existing `Checkmark` object already has an `Image` graphic and Unity did not add a second `Text` graphic to the same GameObject in the runtime inspection.
- Legacy non-English note retained these ASCII code references: `execute_code`, `Active_A`, `toggle.graphic=Text:Checkmark/Glyph`, `labelAlpha=1`.
- Runtime Unity missing-script inspection returned `missingTotal=0`; the visible console still contained older `The referenced script (Unknown) on this Behaviour is missing!` entries with no file/line.
- User reported the Label skill text and checkbox were still not visible. Builder replaced the Text-glyph checkmark approach with Unity built-in `UISprite` and `Checkmark` sprites in `DebugSceneController.ConfigureToggleVisuals(...)`.
- Legacy non-English note retained these ASCII code references: `DebugSceneController/SkillDebugPanel/SkillScroll/Viewport/Content`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `DebugScene.unity`, `labelAlpha=1`, `bgSprite=UISprite`, `checkSprite=Checkmark`, `toggleGraphic=Checkmark`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the same existing warnings.
- Unity refresh/compile completed with editor state `ready_for_tools=true`; Unity console error query showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs and did not show the previous `DebugSceneController requires DebugSetupPanel...` project error.
- User reported `Failed to find UI/Skin/UISprite.psd` from `DebugSceneController.ConfigureToggleVisuals(...)`.
- `Select-String` confirmed the old `UI/Skin` and `GetBuiltinResource<Sprite>` calls were removed from `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs`; the only sprite load is now `Resources.Load<Sprite>("DebugUiSolid")`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Resources/DebugUiSolid.png` was created as a project-owned 1x1 Sprite resource, avoiding Unity built-in UI skin paths.
- Unity Edit Mode scene save updated the actual `DebugSceneController/SkillDebugPanel/SkillScroll/Viewport/Content` slots so `Active_A` through `Passive_J` remain editable scene objects and their `Background` / `Background/Checkmark` images use `DebugUiSolid`.
- Legacy non-English note retained these ASCII code references: `execute_code`, `resourceSprite=DebugUiSolid`, `contentCount=10`, `labelAlpha=1`, `bgSprite=DebugUiSolid`, `checkSprite=DebugUiSolid`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings.
- Unity refresh/compile completed with `resulting_state=idle`; Unity console error query showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs and did not show the `Failed to find UI/Skin/UISprite.psd` project error.
- User requested the same visible/editable rebuild for `EnhancementModal` children.
- Unity read-only `execute_code` first confirmed `EnhancementModal/ChoiceScroll/Viewport/Content` had 8 choices but `Choice_01` had `bgSprite=null` and `checkSprite=null`.
- Unity Edit Mode code deleted all existing children under `DebugSceneController/EnhancementModal`, recreated `Title`, `Summary`, `CloseButton`, `ChoiceScroll/Viewport/Content`, and `Choice_01` through `Choice_08`, and saved `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`.
- Unity read-only `execute_code` then confirmed `modalActive=False`, `title=Enhancements`, `closeButton=True`, `count=8`, `choice01Label=Choice Slot 01`, `labelAlpha=1`, `bgSprite=DebugUiSolid`, and `checkSprite=DebugUiSolid`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and the existing Unity/MCP assembly conflict warnings after the scene rebuild.
- Unity refresh completed with `resulting_state=idle`; Unity console error query showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler logs.

### History

- 2026-04-29: User requested narrower extra projectile angle, immediate lightning branch damage/visuals, and a separate DebugScene for testing monster skills and enhancements through toggles.
- 2026-04-29: Code Builder inspected actual combat scripts, scene files, monster assets, and the SkillSlot enum before editing.
- 2026-04-29: Code Builder implemented branch projectile fields, immediate branch damage, line visuals, DebugScene controller script, and DebugScene scene wiring.
- 2026-04-29: External Code Reviewer found two `eve-a-master-1` spec mismatches and returned `NEEDS_CHANGES`; Builder paused per AGENTS.md.
- 2026-04-30: User approved the prior Reviewer findings and then clarified the desired DebugScene UI flow.
- 2026-04-30: Code Builder fixed `eve-a-master-1` branch damage and magazine size, added `CombatRuntimeController.ApplyDebugSelection(...)`, and rewrote `DebugSceneController` so enemies spawn only from the DebugScene Start button.
- 2026-04-30: User reported the SkillDebugPanel skill list was not visible; Code Builder updated the panel activation order and ScrollRect/LayoutElement sizing, then rebuilt and checked Unity console.
- 2026-04-30: Code Builder attempted the required external Code Reviewer pass, but Codex CLI reported a usage limit and no verdict was produced.
- 2026-04-30: User reported the SkillDebugPanel issue persisted and requested editable scene UI rather than game-run generated UI. Code Builder changed the controller toward scene-bound UI and saved static toggle slots, but the required external Code Reviewer found missing `DebugSetupPanel` setup controls and returned `FAIL`; Builder paused per AGENTS.md.
- 2026-04-30: User instructed Builder to restore `DebugSetupPanel` and setup controls. Builder restored those scene objects and validated build/console, then external Reviewer found the root scale `{0,0,0}` scene issue and returned `FAIL`; Builder paused per AGENTS.md.
- 2026-04-30: User instructed Builder to fix the actual Content skill-list visibility and preserve user-edited UI Scale/Position, and also instructed that Code Reviewer execution now requires user permission. Builder fixed the serialized root scale, kept only a zero-scale runtime guard, rebuilt, refreshed Unity, checked the console, and did not run Code Reviewer.
- 2026-04-30: User reported the `Content` child skill descriptions and checkmarks were still invisible while clicks worked. Builder changed toggle visual binding to normalize scene-bound Label/Background/Checkmark/Glyph elements, applied the same normalization to the current runtime instance, rebuilt, checked Unity console/missing-script state, and did not run Code Reviewer.
- 2026-04-30: User reported the Label skill text and checkbox were still invisible. Builder switched checkboxes to built-in Unity UI sprites, saved the actual scene slots in Edit Mode, rebuilt, refreshed Unity, checked console, and did not run Code Reviewer.
- 2026-04-30: User reported `Failed to find UI/Skin/UISprite.psd` and asked to rebuild `SkillDebugPanel` as visible editable scene UI. Builder removed built-in UI skin sprite usage, created project-owned `Assets/Resources/DebugUiSolid.png`, saved the scene toggle visuals against that sprite, rebuilt, refreshed Unity, checked console, and did not run Code Reviewer because user permission was not granted.
- 2026-04-30: User requested the same rebuild for `EnhancementModal` children. Builder deleted and recreated the modal children as editable scene uGUI objects using `DebugUiSolid`, verified the first choice label/checkmark state, rebuilt, refreshed Unity, checked console, and did not run Code Reviewer because user permission was not granted.
