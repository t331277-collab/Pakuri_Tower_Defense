# UI_BLACKBOARD

This is a domain-specific persistent state file created by the BLACKBOARD.md hierarchy migration.
When doing related work, follow MDTREE.md routing and update this file together with any required parent or child files.

## Scene UI Authoring Rule

- When the user needs to manually edit Unity UI, the scene-authored uGUI hierarchy is the source of truth.
- Runtime code may create or repair only required infrastructure and missing named anchors, but must preserve existing user-authored nonzero transform scale, position, size, labels, child hierarchy, and visual bindings whenever possible.
- For DebugScene specifically, bind scene objects through `BindSceneUi()` and keep `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, skill toggles, and enhancement choice slots editable in `Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity`.
- Avoid runtime-only generated panels for workflows the user needs to inspect or tune in the Unity Editor.
- Prefer project-owned UI resources such as `DebugUiSolid.png` over Unity built-in UI skin paths.

## Migrated Task Blocks

## Task: 2026-05-04 DebugScene Editable UI Authoring Rule

### Task title

Record the editable scene UI authoring rule for DebugScene and shared UI work.

### Goals

- Make the user's requested UI production method persistent in the UI boards.
- Preserve the rule that user-editable scene UI should be bound and repaired, not replaced by runtime-generated UI.
- Connect the rule to the existing retrospective HTML report, current code, scene file evidence, and Unity-MCP scene evidence.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder because the user explicitly requested markdown updates.
- Markdown-only task; no code build is required.
- Do not edit `Pakuri/reference` files.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly request it.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented as a markdown-only board update.

### Next Actions

- Use this rule for future DebugScene, MainMenu, and RunScene UI work when user-editable layout is required.
- Keep domain boards synchronized when a future UI task changes both shared UI policy and a scene-specific UI flow.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html:195-197` records the correction away from runtime-generated UI toward scene-editable UI bound through `BindSceneUi()`.
- `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html:233-237` records the current split: code guarantees shell infrastructure, while panels and toggle slots are scene-saved objects.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:50-56` currently uses `EnsureCanvasShell()`, `EnsureEventSystem()`, and `BindSceneUi()` in `Awake()`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:118` currently loads the project-owned `DebugUiSolid` sprite resource.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scenes/DebugScene.unity` contains the scene UI anchors `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `Choice_01`, and `Choice_08`.
- Unity-MCP confirmed active scene `DebugScene` and found one GameObject each for those UI anchors.

### History

- 2026-05-04: User asked to record the commanded editable UI creation method in the related `.md` files.

## Task: 2026-05-03 DebugScene Setup Panel Toggle

### Task title

Add a DebugScene button that can hide and show `DebugSetupPanel`.

### Goals

- Let the user collapse `DebugSetupPanel` during DebugScene use.
- Keep a visible button outside the setup panel so the panel can be shown again after it is hidden.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground the change in the actual `DebugSceneController` code.
- User performs Play Mode verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly request it for this task.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User verifies in DebugScene Play Mode that the new setup toggle button hides and shows `DebugSetupPanel`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:42` adds `setupToggleButton`.
- `DebugSceneController.cs:187-193` now finds or creates `SetupToggleButton` under the root canvas and binds it to `ToggleSetupPanelVisibility()`.
- `DebugSceneController.cs:504-511`, `:667-685`, and `:724-732` now toggle `DebugSetupPanel.activeSelf`, refresh the button label between `Hide Setup` and `Show Setup`, and create a top-right fallback button when the scene does not already provide one.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` and `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and only the existing Unity/MCP warnings.
- Unity refresh completed with `resulting_state: idle`; Unity console error query returned only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit logs.

### History

- 2026-05-03: User requested a button in DebugScene that can turn `DebugSetupPanel` off and back on.
- 2026-05-03: Code Builder added root-level toggle-button binding plus a fallback button creation path and revalidated with build plus Unity refresh evidence.

## Task: 2026-05-02 Runtime UI Query Contract Unification

### Task title

Make runtime-generated monster selection UI read roster data through `PakuriDataManager`.

### Goals

- Align MainMenu, RunFlow, and DebugScene monster-selection UI with the CSV runtime data contract.
- Remove direct UI-side dependence on `GameDataCatalog.Monsters`.
- Keep existing code-built UI structure intact while changing only the roster query path and missing-data message.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground all claims in actual script edits and actual Unity/editor output.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode verification.
- Code Reviewer was not run because the user did not explicitly permit it.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Implemented and locally validated.

### Next Actions

- User can verify in Play Mode that MainMenu, RunFlow, and DebugScene still populate monster buttons correctly.
- If later requested, the next UI pass can separate scene/UI presentation from data lookup even further, but this task intentionally left the runtime-generated UI structure unchanged.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/MainMenuFlowController.cs:165` now builds its monster buttons from `PakuriDataManager.Instance.GetMonsters(gameDataCatalog)`.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/DebugSceneController.cs:70` and `:217` now use the same data-manager roster query for status checks and button-slot rebuilds.
- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunFlowController.cs:188` now feeds the front-panel monster buttons from `PakuriDataManager`, and `RunFlowController.cs:192` changed the failure hint to point at `Assets/CSVdata/source` plus `Pakuri/CSVRuntime`.
- No prefab/UXML/USS assets were introduced in this pass; the change stayed within the existing runtime-generated UI code path.
- Unity console reads after the script refresh showed the runtime catalog load log and only the pre-existing `The referenced script (Unknown) on this Behaviour is missing!` warnings, not C# compile errors.

### History

- 2026-05-02: User asked Builder to implement query-contract unification.
- 2026-05-02: Builder updated the runtime-generated monster-selection UI scripts to read roster data through `PakuriDataManager` instead of directly from `GameDataCatalog`.

## Task: DebugScene UI Canvas Retrospective Report

### Task title

DebugScene UI Canvas initial approach, user corrections, and fix history HTML report.

### Goals

- Analyze the recent DebugScene UI Canvas work log.
- Summarize the initial runtime-generated UI approach, user correction requests, reviewer findings, and final scene-bound UI solution.
- Write the result as an HTML report under `Pakuri/reference/Report`.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Designer.
- Ground all claims in actual files, code, and command output.
- Do not implement runtime gameplay changes for this report.
- Preserve the repository rule that Play Mode gameplay verification is user-owned.

### Role Owner

Designer

### Status

Completed.

### Next Actions

- Use `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html` as the current written summary if the DebugScene UI flow needs to be discussed again.

### Evidence

- `Get-Content -LiteralPath AGENTS.md` and `Get-Content -LiteralPath BLACKBOARD.md` were run before the response.
- `rg` was not available in this PowerShell environment, so `Select-String` was used.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugSceneController.cs` contains `EnsureCanvasShell`, `BindSceneUi`, `ConfigureToggleVisuals`, and `Resources.Load<Sprite>("DebugUiSolid")`.
- `Select-String` confirmed `DebugScene.unity` contains `DebugSceneController`, `DebugSetupPanel`, `SkillDebugPanel`, `EnhancementModal`, `Active_A`, `Passive_J`, `Choice_01`, and `Choice_08`.
- `Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath Pakuri\Assets\Resources` confirmed `DebugUiSolid.png` and `DebugUiSolid.png.meta` exist.
- Added `Pakuri/reference/Report/2026-04-30-debugscene-ui-canvas-retrospective.html`.

### History

- 2026-04-30: User requested an HTML summary of the initial DebugScene UI canvas creation method, user correction points, and how the problems were solved.
- 2026-04-30: Designer reviewed BLACKBOARD task history and current DebugScene code/scene evidence, then added the retrospective HTML report.

## Task: Combat Visual Sprite Assignment

### Task title

Allow monster/enemy ScriptableObjects and RunScene battlefield background to use editable sprites.

### Goals

- Add editable unit/projectile sprite references to monster and enemy ScriptableObjects under `Assets/Data/GameData`.
- Use assigned monster sprites for the selected monster and its projectiles at runtime.
- Use assigned enemy sprites for enemy bodies and enemy projectiles at runtime.
- Let `RunScene` use an editable battlefield background sprite without forcing the user's manual `BattlefieldBackground` scale.
- Keep unit body `SpriteRenderer.color` values white so assigned unit sprites are not tinted.
- Keep projectile, HP bar, marker, camera background, and battlefield background sprite colors white.

### Constraints

- Role Owner is Code Builder.
- Ground all claims in actual files and command output.
- Do not run Unity-MCP Play Mode gameplay verification; user performs Play Mode verification.
- Preserve unrelated existing worktree changes.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder implementation and local build/Unity console validation completed. User reported Play Mode verification completed. Unit, projectile, HP bar, marker, camera background, and battlefield background sprite color preservation was added. External Code Reviewer run was attempted but interrupted by the user and is not completed.

### Next Actions

- User assigns `UnitSprite` and `ProjectileSprite` on monster/enemy assets as needed.
- User assigns `BattlefieldBackgroundSprite` on `CombatRuntimeController` and adjusts `BattlefieldBackground` Transform Scale manually; keep `Auto Fit Battlefield Background To Field` off when manual scale should be preserved.
- Run Code Reviewer later if the user wants this visual-support change reviewed.

### Evidence

- `MonsterDefinition.cs` now exposes `UnitSprite` and `ProjectileSprite`.
- `EnemyDefinition.cs` now exposes `UnitSprite` and `ProjectileSprite`, and `CloneRuntimeCopy()` preserves both references.
- `CombatRuntimeScene.cs` now reads `MonsterDefinition.UnitSprite` and `MonsterDefinition.ProjectileSprite` into runtime selected sprite fields.
- `CombatRuntimeEnemies.cs` now uses `EnemyDefinition.UnitSprite` for enemy bodies and `EnemyDefinition.ProjectileSprite` for enemy projectiles, falling back to the generated shared sprite when no sprite is assigned.
- `CombatRuntimeProjectiles.cs` now uses the selected monster projectile sprite, falling back to the generated shared sprite when no sprite is assigned.
- `CombatRuntimeController.cs` now exposes `BattlefieldBackgroundAnchor`, `BattlefieldBackgroundSprite`, `BattlefieldBackgroundColor`, and `AutoFitBattlefieldBackgroundToField`.
- `CombatRuntimeScene.cs` now only rewrites `BattlefieldBackground.localScale` when `autoFitBattlefieldBackgroundToField` is true, so manual scale is preserved by default.
- `CombatRuntimeScene.cs` now applies `Color.white` to the selected monster body renderer.
- `CombatRuntimeEnemies.cs` now keeps enemy body renderer colors white in `UpdateEnemyColor()`.
- `CombatRuntimeProjectiles.cs` now applies `Color.white` to selected monster projectiles.
- `CombatRuntimeEnemies.cs` now applies `Color.white` to enemy projectiles and enemy HP bar background/fill sprites.
- `CombatRuntimeController.cs` now initializes marker and battlefield background color fields as `Color.white`.
- `CombatRuntimeScene.cs` now applies `Color.white` to the camera background and battlefield background renderer.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and only the existing 2 MCPForUnity/Unity reference warnings.
- Unity script refresh/compile was requested; console error query returned only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit logs, not project compile errors.
- User reported Play Mode verification completed before the manual background scale fix.

### History

- 2026-04-28: User requested editable projectile images and monster images on `Assets/Data/GameData` enemy/monster SOs, plus an editable RunScene background image.
- 2026-04-28: Code Builder added sprite fields to monster/enemy definitions and wired runtime monster/enemy/projectile renderers to use them.
- 2026-04-28: User reported Play Mode verification completed but found `BattlefieldBackground` scale was forced on game start.
- 2026-04-28: Code Builder changed background auto-fit scaling to an opt-in serialized bool so manual `BattlefieldBackground` scale is preserved by default.
- 2026-04-28: User requested unit sprite colors stay white; Code Builder changed selected monster and enemy body renderers to keep `SpriteRenderer.color` white.
- 2026-04-29: User requested projectile, HP bar, marker, and background colors stay white; Code Builder changed those runtime color assignments to `Color.white`.

## Task: 2026-04-26 Run UI Implementation Status Report

### Task title

HTML report for completed and incomplete Run / UI implementation work on 2026-04-26

### Goals

- Compare today's implementation against `run-systems-integration-summary-report.html` and `monster-select-run-ui-expansion-plan.html`.
- Document completed work, incomplete work, UI editability issues, and chosen UI editing direction.

### Constraints

- All claims must be based on actual files, scene state, command output, or `BLACKBOARD.md` history.
- Do not include work-time estimates in the report.
- Reflect the user's decision that game data is made inside Unity and consumed from Unity assets, not from runtime CSV loading.
- Reflect the user's decision that UI will use editable scene UI: Codex may create a base UI, and user-authored UI should be modified/bound rather than replaced.

### Role Owner

Designer

### Status

Completed.

### Next Actions

- User can open `Pakuri/reference/2026-04-26-run-ui-implementation-status-report.html` to review the report.

### Evidence

- Created `Pakuri/reference/2026-04-26-run-ui-implementation-status-report.html`.
- The report references actual implementation files including `MainMenuFlowController.cs`, `RunCombatUiController.cs`, `RunSceneBootstrap.cs`, `RunStartContext.cs`, `RunSession.cs`, `MonsterDefinition.cs`, and `GameDataCatalog.cs`.
- File timestamp check confirmed the report exists under `Pakuri/reference`.
- Updated the report to remove work-time content, UI Toolkit incomplete-scope content, and user Play Mode verification from the incomplete-scope table.
- Updated the report to state that CSV is not the runtime data path; Unity-created assets such as `MonsterDefinition` and `GameDataCatalog` are the chosen data source.

### History

- 2026-04-26: User requested an HTML work report based on `run-systems-integration-summary-report.html` and `monster-select-run-ui-expansion-plan.html`.
- 2026-04-26: Read both source HTML files, implementation file lists, data asset lists, scene file timestamps, manifest TextMeshPro evidence, and generated the report.
- 2026-04-26: User requested removal of Play Mode verification, work-time content, and UI Toolkit incomplete-scope content; user also fixed the direction to Unity-created data assets and editable scene Canvas UI. Updated the report accordingly.

## Task: RunScene Reward Button Visibility Fix

### Task title

RunScene stage-clear reward buttons are fixed editable slots and visible when rewards exist

### Goals

- Fix the RunScene issue where stage-clear reward buttons did not appear.
- Keep reward UI objects editable in Edit Mode instead of relying on delete/recreate behavior.
- Preserve authored button labels where possible, while runtime reward labels are still assigned from actual reward data.

### Constraints

- No external reviewer for this task; perform simple self-review only.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode; user performs gameplay verification.
- All claims must be based on actual files, scene state, or command output.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder fix applied and self-reviewed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies RunScene stage clear: reward panel appears with reward buttons, selecting a reward enables the continue flow.
- If reward panel appears but a button is blocked or misplaced, inspect the saved RectTransform values of `RewardPanel`, `RewardButtons`, and `RewardButton_0..2`.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/RunCombatUiController.cs` now uses fixed `RewardButton_0`, `RewardButton_1`, and `RewardButton_2` slots under `RewardButtons`.
- `RebuildRewardButtons()` clears only the tracked button list, calls `EnsureRewardButtonSlots(false)`, then activates slots based on `combatController.GetRewardChoiceCount()`.
- `EnsureRewardButtonSlots()` repairs zero-height `RewardButtons`, ensures the three named button slots, and hides non-slot legacy buttons such as `RewardPreviewButton`.
- Existing nonzero reward button slot RectTransforms keep their authored positions/sizes; default positions are applied only when a slot is newly created or has a broken zero size.
- `EnsureButton()` now preserves existing non-empty labels unless an overwrite is explicitly requested or a label is newly created/empty.
- Unity MCP RunScene inspection after `OnEnable` reported `RewardButton_0`, `RewardButton_1`, and `RewardButton_2` active in Edit Mode, and `RewardPreviewButton` inactive.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity assembly version warnings.
- Unity console error check after clearing showed MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit logs only, not project script compile errors.

### History

- 2026-04-26: User reported RunScene reward buttons do not appear.
- 2026-04-26: Scene inspection found `RewardButtons` previously had zero height and fixed reward slots were missing, while monster assets contained reward choice data.
- 2026-04-26: Added persistent reward slots, repaired reward root sizing, hid legacy preview buttons, and made existing RunScene reward UI visible in Edit Mode.

## Task: MainMenu Persistent Editable Panels

### Task title

MainMenuScene stage-transition UI panels are persistent scene objects

### Goals

- MainMenuScene UI transitions must not create/delete runtime screen UI.
- Touch To Start, Run menu, and Character Select must all exist in the scene so the user can edit them together in Edit Mode.
- Future UI direction: authored scene UI is the source of truth; scripts bind callbacks, toggle visibility, and only create missing named anchors.

### Constraints

- No external reviewer for this task; perform simple self-review only.
- Do not run Unity Play Mode; user performs gameplay verification.
- All claims must be based on actual files, scene state, or command output.

### Role Owner

Code Builder

### Status

Builder changes applied and self-reviewed. Waiting for user Play Mode verification.

### Next Actions

- User verifies MainMenuScene flow: Touch To Start -> Run -> Character Select -> RunScene.
- If user edits any of `TouchToStartPanel`, `RunMenuPanel`, `CharacterSelectPanel`, or their child labels/buttons, verify those edits persist after entering Play Mode.

### Evidence

- `Pakuri/Assets/Scripts/Run/MainMenuFlowController.cs` now has separate persistent fields for `touchToStartPanel`, `runMenuPanel`, `characterSelectPanel`, and `monsterButtonRoot`.
- `MainMenuFlowController.OnEnable()` calls `ShowAllPanelsForEditing()` only when `Application.isPlaying` is false, so all panels are visible in Edit Mode.
- Runtime methods `ShowTouchToStart()`, `ShowRunMenu()`, and `ShowCharacterSelect()` call `SetPanelVisibility(...)` and no longer call `Destroy`, `DestroyImmediate`, or `ClearButtons`.
- `EnsureText()` and `EnsureButton()` set default text/style only when a component is newly created, preserving existing authored UI text and styling.
- Unity MCP scene check reported `MainMenuCanvas` child count 3 after cleanup.
- Unity MCP code execution reported `TouchToStartPanel active=True children=3`, `RunMenuPanel active=True children=3`, and `CharacterSelectPanel active=True children=4`.
- Unity MCP code execution reported five persistent character buttons under `MonsterButtons`: `MonsterButton_ariel`, `MonsterButton_eve`, `MonsterButton_rin`, `MonsterButton_sein`, and `MonsterButton_vega`.
- `dotnet build Pakuri\Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` completed with 0 errors and 2 existing Unity/MCPForUnity assembly version warnings.
- Unity console error check showed only MCP-FOR-UNITY client handler exit log entries, not project script compile errors.
- `Pakuri/Packages/manifest.json` search found `com.unity.ugui` and no `com.unity.textmeshpro` line.
- Asset search under `Pakuri/Assets` found no `TextMeshPro`, `TMP_Text`, `TMPro`, or `LiberationSans` usage/assets.
- Generated `Pakuri/Assembly-CSharp.csproj` contains `Unity.TextMeshPro` references, but current project UI scripts and scene-generated UI are still based on `UnityEngine.UI.Text`.

### History

- 2026-04-26: User requested MainMenuScene click-transition screens to be editable at once instead of created/deleted at runtime, and asked why UI text is not TextMeshPro text.
- 2026-04-26: Replaced the single dynamic `MainMenuPanel` flow with persistent `TouchToStartPanel`, `RunMenuPanel`, and `CharacterSelectPanel` scene objects.
- 2026-04-26: Removed the obsolete generated `MainMenuPanel` from `MainMenuScene` and saved the scene.
- 2026-04-26: Verified build, scene hierarchy, persistent character buttons, and console state.
- 2026-04-26: User reported UI Pos X / Pos Y could not be edited. Actual code and scene checks found `VerticalLayoutGroup` and `ContentSizeFitter` on generated UI containers.
- 2026-04-26: Updated `MainMenuFlowController` and `RunCombatUiController` so generated UI containers remove `VerticalLayoutGroup` / `ContentSizeFitter` instead of adding them.
- 2026-04-26: Verified MainMenuScene `TouchToStartPanel`, `RunMenuPanel`, `CharacterSelectPanel`, and `MonsterButtons` report `VLG=False, CSF=False`; also removed and saved those components from RunScene reward/defeat UI containers.
